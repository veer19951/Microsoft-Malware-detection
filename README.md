**1-Problem statement**
- In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

**2-Business Objective and constraints** 
 - Minimize multi-class error.
 - Multi-class probability estimates.
 - Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.
 
**3-Data overview**
- For every malware, we have two files 
  - .asm file
  - .bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header)
  
- Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files and 150GB of data is .asm files:
- There are total 10,868 .bytes files and 10,868 asm files total 21,736 files
- There are 9 types of malwares (9 classes) in our give data
- Types of Malware:
  - Ramnit
  - Lollipop
  - Kelihos_ver3
  - Vundo
  - Simda
  - Tracur
  - Kelihos_ver1
  - Obfuscator.ACY
  - Gatak
 
**4-Machine learning problem formulation**
- There are nine different classes of malware that we need to classify a given a data point => Multi class classification problem
- Metrics
  - Multi class log loss
  - Confusion Matrix
- Split the dataset randomly into three parts train, cross validation and test with 64%,16%, 20% of data respectively
